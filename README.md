"Duuude you are on fire."
I caught fire coding.

I always thought my only dream was to become a professional race car driver (I actually still have high hopes of achieving this one day) sipping on energy drinks and discussing race strategies on world-renown tracks. Reality kicked in when I realized it takes more than just being talented & ambitious to line up on the grid with the worldâ€™s best. Upon this realization I just felt meh, I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different.

And thatâ€™s when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I tore apart an HP desktop using nothing but a butter knife.

Well, I was supposed to be killed that day but looks like I wasnâ€™t. Since then I canâ€™t get enough.

Coding and logging IT supports tickets calls to all my passions; it incorporates tenacity and problem-solving techniques and Iâ€™m allowed to break anything in order to improve it or check for its reliability.

I love applying responsive design principles or replacing a graphics card. Seeing my work behind the screen of another user or hearing those fans turn at exhilarating speeds is an amazing feeling. Itâ€™s oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm kind of like those CSS styled web pages or computer pieces; Iâ€™m adaptive, Iâ€™m mouldable but I still keep my creativity flair intact.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, thinking out of the box & going out of my way to make something work.

So far I have a bit of each that being JavaScript, CSS, C#, & JQuery under my belt. I want to learn Python, Bootstrap, SQL and HTML.
Iâ€™m still enthusiastically grabbing onto any programming language and computer principles I can integrate into my hard drive, my brain of course.ðŸ˜‚
